Code Refractor Homework Assignment

I refracted the code for the Horiseon Social Solutions Services website. 

I replaced all div and span tags with semantic HTML elements, except for line 13, because the "seo" text in the h1 element needs to stand out (though the light gray color it has is not easy to read). Underlining the links in the navigation bar would also make them more accessibile to users, but I did not want to change visual aspects of the webpage design. The a href tags automatically make it so users can use their Tab key to navigate through the page.
